AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
It executes code in response to events, such as changes in data, shifts in state, or user actions. 
AWS Lambda automatically manages the computing resources required by that code and scales automatically, varying from a few requests per day to thousands per second. 
Users only pay for the compute time they consume, and there is no charge when the code is not running.

🗄️ Hands-On with Amazon RDS: Multi-AZ Deployment & Read Replica! ☁️
Continuing my AWS learning journey, I just completed a hands-on project where I deployed an Amazon RDS instance with: 
✅ Multi-AZ configuration for high availability
✅ Read Replica for improved read performance and scalability

This exercise helped me understand:
➡️How AWS ensures fault tolerance and automatic failover.
➡️The role of Read Replicas in distributing read traffic.
➡️Real-world use cases for high availability in cloud databases.

🏗️ Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):
Amazon RDS is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It supports engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and more.

🛡️ Multi-AZ Deployment (High Availability):
What it is:
✨Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment is designed for high availability and automatic failover.
How it works:
✨When you enable Multi-AZ, AWS automatically creates a standby replica of your primary database in a different Availability Zone (a separate data center in the same region).

Key points:
✨The standby is synchronously replicated (real-time copy).
✨It’s not used for reads or writes — only for failover.
✨If the primary DB fails, AWS automatically switches to the standby with minimal downtime.

📖 Read Replica (Scalability)
What it is:
✨A Read Replica is a copy of your database that is used to offload read traffic.
How it works:
✨AWS creates a read-only replica of your primary DB and keeps it updated using asynchronous replication.
Key points:
✨You can have multiple read replicas.
✨Great for read-heavy workloads (e.g., reporting, analytics).
✨You can promote a read replica to become a standalone DB if needed.

🔁 Combined Use Case
✨Use Multi-AZ for reliability and failover.
✨Use Read Replicas for performance and scalability.

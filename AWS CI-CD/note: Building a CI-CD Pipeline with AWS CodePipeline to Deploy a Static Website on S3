🚀 CI/CD in Action with AWS CodePipeline + S3! 🌐

Just completed a hands-on lab where I built a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline to automatically deploy a static website to Amazon S3. This was a great way to understand how DevOps practices work in the cloud!

🔧 What I did:

Created a CodeCommit repository and uploaded index.html and Mount.jpg
Set up an S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled
Configured bucket policies to allow public access
Built a CodePipeline that:
Pulls code from CodeCommit
Skips the build stage (since it’s a static site)
Deploys directly to the S3 bucket
✅ Result: Every time I push changes to the repo, the website is automatically updated! 💡



This lab helped me understand the end-to-end automation of web deployments using AWS-native tools — no manual uploads, no downtime!

💬 Curious about how to set this up or want to try it yourself? Let’s connect!

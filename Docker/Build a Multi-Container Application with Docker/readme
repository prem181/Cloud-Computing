🐳 Docker Deep Dive: Building a Multi-Container Application! 🚀

Just wrapped up an exciting hands-on project where I designed, built, and deployed a multi-container application using Docker and Docker Compose!

🔧 What I did:

1️⃣ Design & Build

Created a modular application with separate containers for:
Frontend (HTML)
Backend (Python)
Database (MySQL)
Used Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to define and orchestrate services
2️⃣ Manage & Troubleshoot

Used docker-compose logs, docker exec, and docker ps to monitor and debug containers
Ensured inter-container communication via Docker networks
3️⃣ Optimize & Deploy

Reduced image size using multi-stage builds
Added health checks and restart policies
Deployed the app locally and tested end-to-end functionality
📦 This hands-on lab gave me a solid understanding of how to:

Break down monolithic apps into microservices
Use Docker Compose for orchestration
Troubleshoot and optimize containerized environments

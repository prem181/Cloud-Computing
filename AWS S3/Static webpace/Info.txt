🌐 Hands-On with Amazon S3: Hosting a Static Website! 🚀

As part of my AWS learning journey, I just created and deployed a simple static web page using Amazon S3!

This project helped me understand: ✅ How to create and configure an S3 bucket for static website hosting
✅ Setting up index.html and error.html pages
✅ Making the bucket publicly accessible (with proper permissions)
✅ Accessing the website via the S3 endpoint URL

📹 I’ve also recorded a video walkthrough of the entire process — from bucket creation to seeing the live site in action. Check it out below! 👇
